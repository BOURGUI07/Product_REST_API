### User Requirement Story for a REST API Performing CRUD Operations on a "Product" Entity

#### Introduction
As a boss overseeing a project that requires a REST API for managing products in an inventory system, I need a detailed user requirement story that outlines the necessary CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a "Product" entity. This API will be built using Spring Boot, Spring Web, and Spring Data JPA, with Maven for dependency management. Postman will be used for testing the API endpoints.


#### Functional Requirements

1. **Create Product**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /products`
   - **Description**: Allows users to create a new product in the inventory.
   - **Request Body**:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "string",
       "description": "string",
       "price": "number",
       "quantity": "integer"
     }
     ```
   - **Response**:
     - `201 Created`: Product successfully created.
     - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input data.
   - **Permissions**: Only Inventory Managers and Administrators can create products.
   - **Implementation**: 
     - **Spring Boot**: For application configuration and setup.
     - **Spring Web**: To define REST endpoints.
     - **Spring Data JPA**: For database interactions.
     - **Maven**: For managing project dependencies.
     - **Postman**: For testing the endpoint.

2. **Read Product**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /products/{id}`
   - **Description**: Retrieves details of a specific product by its ID.
   - **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "integer",
       "name": "string",
       "description": "string",
       "price": "number",
       "quantity": "integer"
     }
     ```
     - `200 OK`: Product details retrieved successfully.
     - `404 Not Found`: Product with the specified ID does not exist.
   - **Permissions**: All user roles can view product details.
   - **Implementation**: 
     - **Spring Boot**: For application configuration and setup.
     - **Spring Web**: To define REST endpoints.
     - **Spring Data JPA**: For database interactions.
     - **Maven**: For managing project dependencies.
     - **Postman**: For testing the endpoint.

3. **Update Product**
   - **Endpoint**: `PUT /products/{id}`
   - **Description**: Updates details of an existing product.
   - **Request Body**:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "string",
       "description": "string",
       "price": "number",
       "quantity": "integer"
     }
     ```
   - **Response**:
     - `200 OK`: Product successfully updated.
     - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input data.
     - `404 Not Found`: Product with the specified ID does not exist.
   - **Permissions**: Only Inventory Managers and Administrators can update products.
   - **Implementation**: 
     - **Spring Boot**: For application configuration and setup.
     - **Spring Web**: To define REST endpoints.
     - **Spring Data JPA**: For database interactions.
     - **Maven**: For managing project dependencies.
     - **Postman**: For testing the endpoint.

4. **Delete Product**
   - **Endpoint**: `DELETE /products/{id}`
   - **Description**: Deletes a specific product from the inventory by its ID.
   - **Response**:
     - `200 OK`: Product successfully deleted.
     - `404 Not Found`: Product with the specified ID does not exist.
   - **Permissions**: Only Administrators can delete products.
   - **Implementation**: 
     - **Spring Boot**: For application configuration and setup.
     - **Spring Web**: To define REST endpoints.
     - **Spring Data JPA**: For database interactions.
     - **Maven**: For managing project dependencies.
     - **Postman**: For testing the endpoint.

5. **List Products**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /products`
   - **Description**: Retrieves a list of all products, optionally filtered by category.
   - **Query Parameters**:
     - `category` (optional): Filter products by category.
   - **Response**:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "id": "integer",
         "name": "string",
         "description": "string",
         "price": "number",
         "quantity": "integer"
       },
       ...
     ]
     ```
     - `200 OK`: List of products retrieved successfully.
   - **Permissions**: All user roles can view the product list.
   - **Implementation**: 
     - **Spring Boot**: For application configuration and setup.
     - **Spring Web**: To define REST endpoints.
     - **Spring Data JPA**: For database interactions.
     - **Maven**: For managing project dependencies.
     - **Postman**: For testing the endpoint.


#### Example Scenarios


1. **Scenario 2: Viewing a Product**
   - Sales Representative sends a `GET /products/5` request.
   - The system retrieves the product details and returns them in a `200 OK` response.

2. **Scenario 3: Updating a Product**
   - Inventory Manager sends a `PUT /products/3` request with updated details.
   - The system validates the input, updates the product, and returns a `200 OK` response.

3. **Scenario 4: Deleting a Product**
   - Administrator sends a `DELETE /products/7` request.
   - The system deletes the product and returns a `200 OK` response.

4. **Scenario 5: Listing Products**
   - User sends a `GET /products` request with an optional `category=electronics` query parameter.
   - The system returns a list of all products, filtered by category if specified, in a `200 OK` response.

#### Conclusion
This user requirement story outlines the essential functionalities and considerations for a REST API managing a "Product" entity. The API should support all necessary CRUD operations, enforce appropriate security measures, and provide robust performance and scalability to meet the needs of different user roles. The technology stack includes Spring Boot, Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Maven, and Postman for testing.
